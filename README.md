# PhD 2048 with keep garbage
A fork of [PhD 2048](https://github.com/ymfa/phd-2048).

I love PhD 2048. But I usually play with this extra rule that you need to have at least one garbage after Paper. So, combining two Experiments, you need to have a garbage. And after that you cannot remove all garbages. It just adds some challenge and makes the game more interesting in my opinion.

Made just for procrastination. [Play it here!](http://mika.letonsaari.net/phd2048garbage/)
